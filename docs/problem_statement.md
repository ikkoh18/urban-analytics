# Problem Statement

Large cities like Los Angeles generate vast amounts of public data related to
mobility, public safety, and environmental conditions. However, these datasets
are often fragmented across different platforms and analyzed in isolation.

This lack of integrated analysis makes it difficult for urban planners and
decision-makers to understand how factors such as traffic patterns, crime
occurrences, and weather conditions interact at the neighborhood level.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an analytical system that integrates
public datasets from the City of Los Angeles to monitor, analyze, and anticipate
urban patterns, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Scope

The initial scope focuses on a limited number of neighborhoods and a recent
time window, serving as a minimum viable product (MVP) that can be expanded in
future iterations.
